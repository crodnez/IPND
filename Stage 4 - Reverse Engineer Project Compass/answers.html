    <!--Student Answer Section-->
    <!-- Directions for completing -->
    <p>Directions: Identify which type of programmer(Front End, Back end, Mobile Programmer or Data Analyst) would work on the features of Project Compass. Type your answers between the paragraph tags and be sure to provide an brief explanation for your choice.</p>

    <!-- Question 1 -->
    <p>1. Which programmer would build and manage the database for storing map pin locations in Project Compass?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 1 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Back End<p>
      <p>Database engineering is a subset of responsibilities that backend programmers concentrate on. Back End Programmers focus on building applications using server-side languages like PHP, Ruby, and Python. That enables servers to connect with a database to look up, save or change data and return it back to the user in form of front-end code.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 2 -->
    <p>2. Which programmer would make Project Compass responsive on different screen sizes on the web?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 2 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Front End<p>
      <p>Creating responsive and scalable web pages that conform to the user's screen size is one responsibility of a Front End Programmer.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 3 -->
    <p>3. Which type of mobile programmer (Android or iOS) would be using Swift to turn Project Compass into a mobile app?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 3 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>IOS<p>
      <p>Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language that is used exclusively for iOS, OS X, tvOS, and watchOS. </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 4 -->
    <p>4. Which programmer would add the image <img class="compass_icon"src="img/compass.svg"> to Project Compass?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 4 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Front End<p>
      <p>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics and it is used to define vecto-based graphics on webpages. Something interesting about SVG files is that they do NOT lose any quality if it is zoomed, resized, or rescaled. That being said, sing this kind of file is something a Front End Programmer would utilize om a web page to define the graphics on images.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 5 -->
    <p>5. Who would evaluate information about Project Compass users to give insights for product decisions?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 5 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Data Analyst<p>
      <p>After information is stored and collected, Data Analysts then explore it to understand the structure and the relationship between features of the data. With this information in hand, data analysts can model the data which will describe the patterns and trends in data to explain the observations or to build functions for predicting future outcomes.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 6-->
    <p>6. Who would make requests to the Google Maps API in Project Compass?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 6 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Front End<p>
      <p>. While Back-End programmers create the API's, the Front-End programmer will create requests to them when building the user interface. Front-End developers access and present data from multiple sources on the internet through API's like Youtube or Google Maps.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 7 -->
    <p>7. Which programmer would need to consider hardware components to make Project Compass usable with a microphone or camera?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 7 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Mobile Programmer<p>
      <p>Depending on the type of application a mobile programmer decides to build, thinking about the hardware components is something that needs to be thought upon. For example, if a mobile programmer wanted to build a simple calculating program, there most likely wouldn't be a need for hardware components. However, if a mobile programmer would like to build an application like Snapchat or Instagram that mainly uses the camera and microphone to function, then developing a code to utilze the hardware components would be necessary.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 8 -->
    <p>8. Which programmer would make a post request endpoint to add comments onto Project compass?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 8 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Back End<p>
      <p>When a user on Facebook or Twitter makes a posts, it looks like a simple task but there is more that goes on behind the scenes of that webpage. Back End Developers build the code that will send the client's data to a server and then sent back to the client's feed.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 9 -->
    <p>9. Which programmer would look at user clicking rates on Project Compass to make recommendations for external tourism sites?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 9 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Data Analyst<p>
      <p>When Data Analyst gets a hold of the clicking rates, they select the proper statistical tests to understand how to interpret the results. From that point, the Data Analyst can observe trends and make calculated predictions to make those recommended tourism sites. </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 10 -->
    <p>10. After evaluating these four different paths into programming, which role are you most interested in pursuing? Why?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 10 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Front End<p>
      <p>I chose Front End Programming because while it is challenging to learn, it feeds my creative nature. I'm all about customizing things to a person's unique wants and how to present that on a screen for user's to see and interact with websites. </p>
